								<h2>Did I have a plan for success?</h2>
								<p>My plan to play super mario brothers on the Raspberry Pi board was to first install the Super Mario Brother program on the Raspberri Pi board. In order to do this, I needed to look up several resources for how to do this and also figure out how to control the game once it is hooked up. My plan was to try each step of this process by first installing one small application on there to figure it out. Then I needed to install the Super Mario Application. </p>

								<h2>Did I use an agile model or a waterfall model?</h2>
								<p>I used a waterfall model because I planned all of it out and then tried to execute it after the plan was fully formulated. This makes for a difficult process, because you have to wait to implement or develop and changes before testing. That means if the plan does not work you have to go back to square one and start over with a new plan. I will be implementing this plan on Wednesday to see if the project is sucessfull or not. </p>

								<h2>What is one thing that I leared along the way?</h2>
								<p>I learned that setting up something as simple as a video game, Super Mario Brothers, on a Raspbery Pi can be a difficult feat. This is because you must first install an operating system. Next I must ensure that every program is properly moved to the Raspberry Pi because using it with the monitor attached can be more difficult than intended because of the speed of the video card.</p>

								<h2>Did I have a plan for success?</h2>
								<p>My plan to use resources as I set up the Super Mario envrionment as proven well. There are several people before me that have done this and have tried to get it to work. </p>
